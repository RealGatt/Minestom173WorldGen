## Minestom Beta 1.7.3 World Generator
Mostly working. Probably.

Heavily based off of [SpottedLeaf](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/OldGenerator)'s work.

# Not implemented:
- Other dimensions
- Actual good thread management (any sort of thread management)
- Decent speed
- Half a brain about proper world gen

# Implemented
- Most decorations
- Chunk loading and populating
- Chunk unloading and stuff
- Cave Gen
- Ore Gen
- Yeet


See [Example](https://github.com/RealGatt/Minestom173WorldGen/blob/master/src/main/java/space/gatt/minestom173worldgen/Example.java) for usage
